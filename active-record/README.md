## Intent

An Active Record pattern provides a data persistence mechanism having that one encapsulated within
the domain model itself.
While DAO pattern strictly adheres to the separation of concerns principle an Active Record encapsulates 
all the data persistence and business logic within the domain model itself.
The following pattern might be particularly useful when it's required to quickly draft data access
implementation with as less effort as possible.
