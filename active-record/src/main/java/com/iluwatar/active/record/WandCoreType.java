/**
 * The core of a wand is a magical substance placed within the length of wood. They are usually
 * bits of hair/feather extracted from some sort of Magical Being or Creature. The materials used
 * for wand cores can vary widely, though certain wand-makers may prefer to use certain materials;
 * for example, Garrick Ollivander discovered and pioneered the use of phoenix feathers, dragon heartstrings,
 * and unicorn tail hairs.
 *
 * Created by Stephen Lazarionok.
