## Intent
It represents a mathematical model of a finite number of states and their transitions and actions, 
and is an efficient programming method within a logical unit. Make the program logic clear and easy
to understand.


## Applicability
Use the Finite-state-machine pattern when

* There are finite state for our model or software.
