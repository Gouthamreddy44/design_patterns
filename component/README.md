## Applicability
Use the Component pattern when you want to

* You have a class that touches multiple domains which you want to keep decoupled from each other.
* A class is getting massive and hard to work with
* You want to be able to define a variety of objects that share different capabilities, but using inheritance doesnâ€™t let you pick the parts you want to reuse precisely enough.
