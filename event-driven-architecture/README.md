## Intent

Send and notify state changes of your objects to other applications using an Event-driven Architecture.

## Explanation

Real world examples

> Chargify, a billing API, exposes payment activity through various events (https://docs.chargify.com/api-events)
> Amazon's AWS Lambda, lets you execute code in response to events such as changes to Amazon S3 buckets, updates to an Amazon DynamoDB table, or custom events generated by your applications or devices. (https://aws.amazon.com/lambda)
> MySQL runs triggers based on events such as inserts and update events happening on database tables.

In plain words

> A modern design approach that revolves around data to define events

Wikipedia says

> a software architecture paradigm promoting the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events.

**Programmatic example**

## Applicability

Use an Event-driven architecture when

- you want to create a loosely coupled system
- you want to build a more responsive system
- you want a system that is easier to extend

## Tutorials

## Known Uses

## Consequences

> The unduly complexity of an event-driven architecture is due to many events, producers, and consumers revolving around different business flows and processes.

> The debugging process is complicated because when one event on the queue is consumed by 3 different services with another service was triggered to consume a secondary event based on one of those services.
